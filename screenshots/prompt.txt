My prompt has many cool and useful features:

- The return value of the last command.  If the value indicates a signal, the
  signal's short name is appended in parentheses.  If the last command was a
  pipeline, each return value is listed separately (including signals).

- The command number, for use with (e.g.) !1234 and as a subliminal cue to which
  session you're in.

- The username and short hostname.

- The full path, in case (for example) you're in a deeply-nested source tree
  and need to run a command on a parent directory.

- If the current directory is in a source-control repo, the name of the current
  branch/bookmark is included.

- If a command is currently running in the background, a dot is prepended to
  the ending mark(s).  (If there are multiple backgrounded commands, there's
  still only one dot.)

- If running under mosh, tmux, and/or screen, 'M', 'T', and/or 'S' is/are
  prepended to the ending marks.  (Not shown in the screenshot.)

- Nested shells increase the number of ending marks.

- The ending mark is $ for a non-root user, # for root.

- ***RAINBOWS*** (ahem)  Having separate colors for each section makes them
  easier to identify quickly.  The screenshot is from iTerm2 on OSX, with the
  Tango Dark colorset.

Source is in dot.bashrc (prompt section) and
dot.bashrc.d/{errorcode_prompt.pre,scm-prompt.pre}.
