My prompt has many cool and useful features:

- The return value of the last command.  If the value indicates a signal, the
  signal's short name is appended in parentheses.  If the last command was a
  pipeline, each return value is listed separately (including signals).

- The command number, for use with (e.g.) !1234 and as a subliminal cue to which
  session you're in.

- The username and short hostname.

- The full path, in case (for example) you're in a deeply-nested source tree
  and need to run a command on a parent directory.

- If the current directory is in a source-control repo, the name of the current
  branch/bookmark is included.

- If a command is currently running in the background, a dot is prepended to
  the ending mark(s).  (If there are multiple backgrounded commands, there's
  still only one dot.)

- Nested shells increase the number of ending marks.

- The ending mark is $ for a non-root user, # for root.

- ***RAINBOWS*** (ahem)  The screenshot is from iTerm2 on OSX, with the Tango
  Dark colorset.
