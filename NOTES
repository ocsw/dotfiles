bash:

- variables don't need to be quoted on the right side of an assignment
  or in [[]]
- $() / `` strip trailing \n

- I'm going to use [] and = unless specifically using bash features (and
  quote variables)
- I'm going to quote all variables including in assignments to build the habit
  of quoting for when it's necessary
- I'm also going to quote text strings for clarity and syntax highlighting
- I'm going to leave quotes off foo=$() because it's not as necessary for habit
  reasons and it tends to make lines hard to read, since $() frequently contains
  quotes
- I'm going to use "" unless strings contain $ or "
  ---
  Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all
  characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and, when
  history expansion is enabled, !.
  The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the
  following characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>.
- if multiple arguments to a program would otherwise have different quoting, I
  will make them consistent
- I'm going to use '' for sed, awk, single-character delimiters, and tr, unless
  there's a specific reason not to
- old note, kept for reference:
  (aliases used \more)
  - any later aliasing of 'more' ordinarily wouldn't affect these because
    aliases are expanded when functions are defined, not executed
  - but re-sourcing this file afterwards _would_ change the definitions
  - so, use backslashes
  - however, making 'more' a function will still change these
